FLOATING POINT CODING RULES

For the problems that require you to implement floating-point operations,
the coding rules are less strict.  You are allowed to use looping and
conditional control.  You are allowed to use both ints and unsigneds.
  
  You can use arbitrary integer and unsigned constants. You can use any 
arithmetic, logical, or comparison operations on int or unsigned data.

  You are expressly forbidden to:
  1. Define or use any macros.
  2. Define any additional functions in this file.
  3. Call any functions.
  4. Use any form of casting.
  5. Use any data type other than int or unsigned.  This means that you
  cannot use arrays, structs, or unions.
  6. Use any floating point data types, operations, or constants.
