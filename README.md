# BX-information
This repo is created for sharing information of the courses in Bachelor program of l'X. There are some personal experiments of the courses, links to files which are helpful at that time for understanding the courses and preparing the finals and some personal solutions of the homework and projects.



I hope these could help you guys when you getting stuck at some points. Some professor might reuse the exercises so please notice that

- **Copy is forbidden!!!**

- These answers just a reference when you get stuck! Learning knowledge is the point of learning not getting a higher grades or finishing the homework!
- The penalty for plagiarism is very serious at l'X
- There are only the **unofficial** answer. There might be some slight mistake so please be careful! The idea is only to help you know the direction of solving the homework! Not directly giving the answer!



Please fell free to contribute this repo by directly request a pull.
